### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm final year mechatronics student at the faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Robotics AGH.

- ðŸ”Š For my master's thesis, I have taken up the subject of nondestructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM) using ultrasonic waves to inspect structural defects and material properties. 

- ðŸ’§ I graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. My engineer thesis concerned the numerical analysis of fluid flow (CFD) through a Tesla check valve.
